# [ASSIGNMENT] Individual Project  
## **Jullaphong Jiamwatthanaloet 6510545314**

---

## 1) Framework:
**Selected Framework:** Django  
**Reasons:**  
- Django is a framework that allows fast development of a simple web application.  
- It includes built-in support for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and user authentication.  
- This matches the requirements of this project, which requires authentication and storing data in the database.  
- It supports storing image URLs as part of the model table, which also matches the optional requirement that a todo item contains the image.

---

## 2) Database:  
### **Main Database**  
**Type:** PostgreSQL (Docker Container)  
**Structure:**  
The application uses PostgreSQL for storing both authentication and todo-related data. The tables include:

However, the key tables to focus on are:

- **auth_user:** Automatically created by Django to manage user credentials and authentication.

- **todo_todo:** Custom table created to store todo items. Apart from basic information, it also allows the user to set an image and due date for the todo item.

Apart from the main database, I also utilize **Object Storage** to store images of the todo items.  

### **Object Storage:**  
**Type:** MinIO  
**Structure:**  
Used for storing images of todo items uploaded by the user. The images are stored in the todo-media bucket, and Django handles referencing the image URLs through its ImageField.

## 3) GitHub Repository:  
[https://github.com/J-Jullaphong/getthingsdone](https://github.com/J-Jullaphong/getthingsdone)

---

## 4) Application Deployment:
### 1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/J-Jullaphong/getthingsdone.git
cd getthingsdone
```
### 2. Create a .env file for externalized variables. (For simplicity in this project, you can just use default values):
- **Linux and macOS**  
  ```bash
  cp sample.env .env
  ```
- **Windows**  
  ```bash
  copy sample.env .env
  ```
### 3. Start the app:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
### 4. Access the app via:
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 5. To stop the app:
```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```

## 5) Code Explanation:
The application follows Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, which is a variant of the Layered Architecture Style. This structure helps organize the application into clearly defined layers: models for data, views for business logic, and templates for presentation.

### Models:
This model is designed to support all core features of the application, including ownership, deadline tracking, status updates, and optional image uploads.

**Todo:**  
This model represents each todo item. It includes:  
- A UUID primary key for unique identification.  
- A ForeignKey to the User model, ensuring that each todo is linked to the user who created it.  
- Fields for title, description, and status, with status being a choice between "Pending", "In Progress", or "Done".  
- An optional image field, allowing users to upload a picture associated with the todo. Uploaded images are stored using a custom file path (`todo_images/{uuid}.ext`).  
- A created_at timestamp and an optional due_date.  
- A `clean()` method that validates the due_date to ensure it isn't set in the past.  
- An `is_overdue` property that checks whether the task is overdue and not marked as done.

### Views:
Views are based on Django class-based views and use `LoginRequiredMixin` to ensure only authenticated users can access them.

- **SignUpView:** Handles user registration using a custom user creation form.
- **LoginView:** Handles user login using a custom authentication form.
- **LogoutView:** Logs out the user and redirects to the login page.
- **TodoListView:** Displays the list of todo items belonging to the currently logged-in user.
- **TodoCreateView:** Allows the user to create a new todo item.
- **TodoDeleteView:** Allows deletion of a todo item.
- **TodoUpdateView:** Enables editing an existing todo item.

### Templates:
Templates are built with Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI and follow a consistent layout using `base.html`.
- **login.html, signup.html:** For user authentication
- **todo_list.html:** For displaying tasks
- **partial/add_todo_modal.html:** A modal partial for adding a todo item
- **partial/update_todo_modal.html:** A modal partial for editing a todo item

### Forms:
Forms are based on Django's form system and customized to provide a better user experience using Bootstrap styling. They handle input validation, layout, and integration with the database models.
- **CustomAuthenticationForm:** Extends Djangoâ€™s login form with Bootstrap styling.
- **CustomUserCreationForm:** Used for user registration, also styled with Bootstrap.
- **TodoForm:** Handles user input for creating and updating todo items. Includes fields for the title, description, status, image, and due date.

### AJAX Functionality:
AJAX is used to make the application feel more dynamic and interactive without requiring full page reloads:

- **Drag & Drop Status Updates:** Tasks can be dragged between status columns (e.g., from "Pending" to "In Progress"). The status is updated via AJAX in the background.
- **Add Todo (AJAX Modal):** Clicking the "Add Task" button opens a Bootstrap modal. The form submission is handled via AJAX and updates the board instantly after success.
- **Update Todo (AJAX Modal):** Clicking a todo card opens a modal prefilled with the todo's data. The update is performed via AJAX, and the UI refreshes accordingly.
- **Delete Todo:** Users can delete a task directly from the modal using an AJAX-powered confirmation button.
- **Image Previews:** JavaScript provides a live preview of uploaded images before submission, improving the user experience and reducing upload errors.
